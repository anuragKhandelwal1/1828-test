That one thing would be - Writing code with a long term perspective.



The code is a language and it should be created for a wide range of people.

Like when any language would've been created, example Sanskrit, it was made so scientifically that it includes almost all the aspects of communication.

The code written, should cover all aspects of requirements and with high quality so the maintenance cost is low.
